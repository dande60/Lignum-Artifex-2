          <h2>A Passion for Detail</h2>
          <p>It began early in life. From my Italian heritage-coming from a long line of artistic woodworkers in the family-skills and traditions were passed down from generation to generation. Watching, questioning, and learning from an early age set the stage for later in life.</p>
          <p>I took their wisdom and knowledge and fused it with modern technology to create beautiful, handmade items. What began as building something out of necessity grew into a full-time company specializing in custom, handcrafted goods.</p>
          <p>Artistry isn't just the execution and production of new Lignum Artifex pieces; it's also ensuring that each piece will look beautiful wherever it is displayed. Contact us to learn more about how we can work with you.</p>
