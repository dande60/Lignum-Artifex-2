    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2>A Passion for Detail</h2>
    <p>
      It began Early in life From my Italian Heritage coming from a long line of Artistic wood workers in the family passed down from generation to generation. Watching questioning and learning from an early age set the stage for later in life. I took there wisdom and knowledge and fused it with modern technology, to create beautiful, handmade items. What began as building something out of necessity, grew into a full-time company specializing in custom handcrafted goods. Artistry isn't just the execution and production of new Lignum Artifex pieces, it's also making sure each piece will look beautiful wherever it'll be displayed. Contact us to learn more about how we can work with you.
